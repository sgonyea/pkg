# PKG -- A RubyGems Rip-Off For Your Lunix Packaging Needs

### Caveats

Currently, only RPM is supported. Deb support will come eventually.

The use of Git is a baked in assumption. Please submit a patch for your particular use-case, if this is un-desirable.

It is likely that my laser-like focus on solving my own problem has insulted the RPM specification. Indeed, I'm sure it has. Patches are welcome, to improve feature support.
